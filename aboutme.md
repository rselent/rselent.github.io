### Hi there! 

You might have guessed it by now, but I am not, in fact, that handsome pupper enshrined at the top of this page. He __is__ a _good boy,_ though.

Ok, just had to clear that up.

My name is Ray, and I created this site as a means to chronicle and talk about my own journey as a data scientist -- how I arrived at this wonderfully exciting confluence of disciplines, interesting projects that I create or contribute to, or perhaps even just as a memorable or easily bookmark-able location where you can find multiple avenues of contacting me.

Coming to data science with a strong background in performing arts like broadcasting and theatre, on top of my honed technical abilities, means that I'm able to offer every project I work on and person I work with the potential for exceptionally unique and creative ways of analyzing and solving problems. Or a wicked Michael Buffer impression... I can offer that too, I guess...

In my free time, I like to spend time with my dog, learn new songs on my bass guitar


### Currently working on


### Wait, that's it?
