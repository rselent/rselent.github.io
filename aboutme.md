### Hi there!  
You might have guessed it by now, but I am not, in fact, that handsome pupper enshrined at the top of this page. He __is__ a _good boy,_ though.

Ok, just had to clear that up.

My name is Ray, I'm currently a data science student at _Lambda School_,  and I created this site as a means to chronicle and talk about my own journey as a data scientist: 
* how I arrived at this wonderfully exciting confluence of disciplines, 
* interesting projects that I create or contribute to, 
* or perhaps even just as a memorable or easily bookmark-able location where you can find multiple avenues of contacting me. ;)

Coming to data science with a background in performing arts like broadcasting and theatre, on top of my life-long technical abilities, means that I'm able to offer every project I work on (and person I work with) the potential for exceptionally unique and creative ways of analyzing and solving problems. Or a wicked Michael Buffer impression... I can offer that too, I guess...

In my free time, I like to spend time with my dog, learn new songs on my bass guitar, explore nature with friends, travel, and play video games.

### Current projects/obsessions?  
Absolutely! In addition to adding more content to this site from my journey here at Lambda School, I'm currently working on a project that identifies emoji inside scraped social media posts, even if that scraped data has been encoded outside the standard unicode/utf-8.

### Wait, that's it?  
Yeah, that's it. I mean, come on, this isn't supposed to be a _biography,_ right? Maybe that's something I can explore adding later, but until then, if you'd like to know more about me, feel free to contact me through my email, linkedin, or github links below!
