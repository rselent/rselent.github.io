### Hi there!  
You might have guessed it by now, but I am not, in fact, that handsome pupper enshrined at the top of this page. He __is__ a _good boy,_ though.

Ok, just had to clear that up!

| My name is Ray, I'm currently a data science student at _Lambda School_, this probably isn't the best picture of me, and I created this site as a means to showcase interesting projects that I work on and chronicle and talk about my own journey as a data scientist: | <img src="https://rselent.github.io/assets/img/avatar-icon2.png" width="900"> |

* how I arrived at this wonderfully exciting confluence of disciplines, 
* interesting projects that I create or contribute to, 
* or perhaps even just as a memorable or easily bookmark-able location where you can find multiple avenues of contacting me. ;)

Coming to data science with a background in performing arts like broadcasting and theatre, on top of my life-long technical abilities, means that I'm able to offer every project I work on (and person I work with) the potential for exceptionally unique and creative ways of analyzing and solving problems. Or a wicked Michael Buffer impression... I can offer that too, I guess...

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my dog, learning new songs on my bass guitar, exploring and appreciating nature with friends, traveling, and playing video games.

### Any current projects/obsessions?  
Absolutely! In addition to adding more content to this site from my journey here at Lambda School, I'm currently working on a project that aims to identify emoji inside scraped social media posts, even if that scraped data has been encoded outside the utf-8 standard, has incomplete emoji data, or both. Super interesting, right!? I thought so...

### So wait, that's it?  
Yeah, _that's it._ I mean, come on, this isn't supposed to be a __*biography,*__ right? Maybe that's something I can explore adding later, but until then, if you'd like to know more about me, feel free to contact me through my email, linkedin, or github links found at the bottom of every page!
