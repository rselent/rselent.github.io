Ever since the days of Tycho Brahe studying the distance of comets from Earth in the 16th century, or the 1898 discovery of the first-ever recorded Near-Earth Asteroid, 433 Eros, we've been captivated by and enamoured with what happens beyond the veil of our atmosphere. We've also been fearful of being smote by cosmic deities, forces, or even just the cosmos itself.

100 years after the discovery of 433 Eros, in March of 1998, new observational data gathered from the University of Arizona's Spacewatch Project led the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts to make a prediction that ultimately shook both media headlines and the world: *recently discovered 1km-wide asteroid 1997 XF<sub>11</sub> could hit Earth in 2028!*  
According to NASA, an asteroid that has a diameter of just 140 meters (a little more than 1.5 football fields) is large enough to destroy an entire city, and one with a diameter of over 1 kilometer (just under half of a mile) is capable of destroying *billions* of people on Earth. 




In 1998, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), based in Pasadena, California, created
